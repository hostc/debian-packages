Description: Biometric Authentication Service
 The service layer of the biometric identification authentication framework.
 The service layer uses the DBus bus to provide the upper application with
 operation interfaces such as feature enroll, feature verify, feature identify,
 feature search, feature delete, etc. Meanwhile, it also provides notification
 of device status changes event and notification of USB device hotplug event.
 .
 This package contains a library for biometric authentication.
